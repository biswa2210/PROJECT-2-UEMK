## About :point_down: 

<div align="justified">
   
In computer security, logging in (or logging on, signing in, or signing on) is the process by which an individual gains access to a computer system by identifying and authenticating themselves. The user credentials are typically some form of "username" and a matching "password", and these credentials themselves are sometimes referred to as a login (or logon, sign-in, sign-on). In practice, modern secure systems often require a second factor such as email or SMS confirmation for extra security.
It is the first part of my project. Logging in is usually used to enter a specific page, website or application, which trespassers cannot see. Once the user is logged in, the login token may be used to track what actions the user has taken while connected to the site. Logging out may be performed explicitly by the user taking some actions, such as entering the appropriate command or clicking a website link label as such. It can also be done implicitly, such as by the user powering off his or her workstation, closing a web browser window, leaving a website, or not refreshing a website within a defined period.<br>
To get started with algorithm visualizer there is a sign up section where user has to give his username, valid email id and password. If user give wrong data while login he won't open. After signing up user has to login with his email id and password. There is also a sign out section for user when he has finished his work. It is just like any other login systems.

## Things needed for signup/login :point_down:

 - [x] valid email id
 - [x] username
 - [x] password
 
## LINK : :point_right: https://algo-visualize-login-signup.vercel.app/login

## Purpose :point_down: 

<div align="justified">
   
On a more advanced level, logins provide a security layer between unsecured and secure activity. Once a user logs in to a secure website, for example, all data transfers are typically encrypted. This prevents other systems from viewing or recording the data transferred from the server. I have made this to make everyone's account safe and efficient.
</div>

## Use :point_down:

User(first time) has to give his username, password and valid email id. While login user has to give email id and password and after using user has to sign out for safety.

## Importance :point_down:

<div align="justified">
   
Enabling a user to create an account and log in, is equipping them with security for and control over their information. When a user can see the information they've given you in their user profile, they understand what you're using to connect with them. Login system is important for any web application or android application for user's personalization and data safety. No one can see user's personal messages in discussion section or any other thing related to his account in algorithm visualizer.

## Making :point_down:

It has been created using advance JavaScript, advance CSS3, SCSS, ReactJS, advance HTML5, Vercel, Firebase, nodejs and Formik. It is fully responsive.<br> I have connected the user name with [chat engine](https://www.chatengine.io/).<br> In the main page the user secret for each user is provided by [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).<br> I have used [vercel](https://vercel.com) and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).<br>
