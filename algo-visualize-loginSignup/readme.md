## About :point_down: 
It is the first part of my project. To get started with algorithm visualizer there is a sign up section where user has to give his username, valid email id and password. If user give wrong data while login he won't open. After signing up user has to login with his email id and password. There is also a sign out section for user when he has finished his work. It is just like any other login systems.
## LINK : :point_right: https://algo-visualize-login-signup.vercel.app/login
## Purpose :point_down: 
I have made this to make everyone's account safe and efficient.
## Use :point_down:
User(first time) has to give his username, password and valid email id. While login user has to give email id and password and after using user has to sign out for safety.
## Importance :point_down:
Login system is important for any web application or android application for user's personalization and data safety. No one can see user's personal messages in discussion section or any other thing related to his account in algorithm visualizer.
## Making :point_down:
It has been created using advance JavaScript, advance CSS3, SCSS, ReactJS, advance HTML5, Vercel, Firebase, nodejs and Formik. It is fully responsive. I have connected the user name with [chat engine](https://www.chatengine.io/). In the main page the user secret for each user is provided by [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/). I have used [vercel](https://vercel.com) and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).
