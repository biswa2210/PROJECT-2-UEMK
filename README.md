## About :point_down: 
*This is the project of second year fourth semester*. This is a web application which is used to visualise algorithms. User can approach this website through a provided link. First of all it has a sign up or login page. If user is opening it for first time he has to select sign up option. Here he has to give username, email id, password, verify password. If he has already signed up, then he has to go to login option and then he has to give email, password, confirm password. Then you have entered in the main page or home page. Here user can see your email id and a firebase-provided password. Here four buttons are given. VISUALIZE ALGORITHMS, ALGORITHMS, DISCUSSION, FEEDBACK. By clicking on VISUALIZE ALGORITHMS user can watch and understand working of some specific algorithms. If user goes to ALGORITHMS he can see total _72_ algorithms. Sorting, Searching and Others algorithms. If he clicks any of them in learn more button then their details will be shown in a page. The DISCUSSION part will take the user to a login page where he has to give username and password (firebase-provided password in home page). Then he will be added in a discussion group for doubt clearing where the developers will answer his questions regarding this website. In the feedback portion user can write about how much this website is useful or any idea for improvement in this website in the comment section.

## Purpose :point_down:
I have made this website to easily study algorithms.
## User Guide :point_down:
To use this Algorithm Visualizer, user have to follow these steps given below:
First you have to open the provided link. Then a sign up or login page will open. If you are opening it for first time select sign up option. Give your username, email id, password, verify password. If you have already signed up, then go to login option. Give your email, password, confirm password. 
Then you have entered in the main page or home page. Here you can see your email id and a firebase-provided password.<br>
1.Click on Visualize Algorithms. Here you can watch and understand working of some specific algorithms. Go back to main page.<br>
2.Click on Algorithms. Here you can see total 72 algorithms. Sorting, Searching and Others algorithms. Click any of them in learn more button to read their details. Go back to main page.<br>
3.Click on discussions. Here you have to enter your username and password (firebase-provided password in home page). Then you will be added in a discussion group for doubt clearing where the developers will answer your questions regarding this website. Go back to main page.<br>
4.Click on feedback. Here you can write in the comment section. You can write about how much this website is useful or any idea for improvement in this website. Go back to main page.<br>
## Importance :point_down:
Using this web application user can stusy interesting things about algorithms and learn how they actually work.
## Making :point_down:
It has been created using advance JavaScript, advance CSS3, SCSS, ReactJS, advance HTML5, Vercel, Firebase, Chat Engine XDK, nodejs and Formik. It is fully responsive.<br>
I have used @mediascreens for making it responsive. I have used [nodejs](https://nodejs.org) and [vercel](https://vercel.com).<br>
I have used blob effect in css and [svg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) in the main page.<br>
For references for algorithms I have used [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and [wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).<br>
For all custom images in algorithms part I have used [photoshop](www.adobe.com/Adobe/Photoshop).<br>
For backend I have used [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) which provides a user secret to every user which they use for discussion portion.
In discussion part for chatting I have used [chat engine](https://chatengine.io/) and I have made a project in api which provides our project secret key.<br>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
