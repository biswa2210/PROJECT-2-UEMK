## About 
It is the functionality 1 of my project. Algorithm Visualizer is an online platform that visualizes algorithms from as per user choice. Algorithm-visualizer is a web app written in React. It contains UI components and interprets commands into visualizations. Here are two types of algorithms, searching and sorting. Here user will get a tutorial for using this web application. Here we can set the size, speed, name of algorithm them it will show how the algorithm actually works.

## Purpose
I have made this to make learning algorithms an interesting, facsinating and easy work. 
## Use
Clicking on Visualize Algorithms user can see searching visualizer and there in the drop down menu user has to choose sorting algorithms to watch and understand working of some specific algorithms. User can read the tutorial which describes how to use that web application. User can change the values to see different working way.
## Importance
 Learning an algorithm gets much easier with visualizing it. So it is a great way to study and understand algotihms.
