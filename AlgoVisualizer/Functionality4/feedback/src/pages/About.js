      <p className="suk">Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive online platform that visualizes algorithms from code. Learning an algorithm gets much easier with visualizing it. Algorithm visualizer is a web app written in React. It contains UI components and interprets commands into visualizations. Algorithms are a fascinating use case for visualization. To visualize an algorithm, we donâ€™t merely fit data to a chart; there is no primary dataset. Instead there are logical rules that describe behavior. This may be why algorithm visualizations are so unusual, as designers experiment with novel forms to better communicate. This is reason enough to study them.</p>

      <h3 className="homeheading2"><u>ALGORITHMS SECTION</u></h3>
      <p className="suk">In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks. As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time, and in a well defined formal language for calculating a function. Starting from an initial state and initial input (perhaps empty), the instructions describe a computation that, when executed, proceeds through a finite number of well defined successive states, eventually producing "output" and terminating at a final ending state. Here we can see different type of algorithms and their details.</p>

      <h3 className="homeheading2"><u>DISSCUSSION SECTION</u></h3>
      <p className="suk">The DISCUSSION part will take the user to a login page where he has to give username and password (firebase-provided password in home page). Then he will be added in a discussion group for doubt clearing where the developers will answer his questions regarding this website. Discussion is important for any queries of user. When developers guide the user properly it will very helpful for the user to explore the web site. The purpose of the discussion is to interpret and describe the significance of your findings in light of what was already known about the research problem being investigated and to explain any new understanding or insights that emerged as a result of your study of the problem.</p>

      <p className="suk">Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop. The system can then be said to feed back into itself. The notion of cause-and-effect has to be handled carefully when applied to feedback systems: Simple causal reasoning about a feedback system is difficult because the first system influences the second and second system influences the first, leading to a circular argument. This makes reasoning based upon cause and effect tricky, and it is necessary to analyze the system as a whole. Website feedback is information obtained directly from website users through on-page surveys, feedback widgets, and other techniques to help organizations understand what people think (and how they feel) about their websites and landing pages.</p>
