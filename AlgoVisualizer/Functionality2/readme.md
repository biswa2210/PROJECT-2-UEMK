## About 
It is the 2nd functionality of my project. In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for performing calculations, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks. As an effective method, an algorithm can be expressed within a finite amount of space and time, and in a well-defined formal language for calculating a function. This part provides 72 cards containing details of different algorithms. Here are 3 types of algorithms, searching, sorting and others.

## Purpose
I have made this to make learning algorithms an interesting, facsinating and easy work. 
## Use
Clicking on Algorithms user can see 72 cards of different algorithms. When user clicks on "learn more" in card a page opens showing time complexity, space complexity, definitions etc details.
## Importance
 Learning an algorithm gets much easier with getting compact details without searching in goolge or in any book. So it is a great way to study and understand algotihms.
# ALGO-VISUALIZE-PART
 I have used HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, REACT to make this. It is fully responsive.
