    <h1>TIM SORT</h1>
    <p>Timsort is a hybrid stable sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. It was implemented by Tim Peters in 2002 for use in the Python programming language.</p>

      <h3><u>TIME COMPLEXITY</u></h3>
      <p>Best Case Time Complexity: O(n)</p>
     <p>Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n log n)</p>
    <p>Average Case Time Complexity: O(n log n)</p>  
    <p>In the worst case, Timsort takes O(n\log n)}O(n\log n) comparisons to sort an array of n elements. In the best case, which occurs when the input is already sorted, it runs in linear time, meaning that it is an adaptive sorting algorithm.It is advantageous over Quicksort for sorting object references or pointers because these require expensive memory indirection to access data and perform comparisons and Quicksort's cache coherence benefits are greatly reduced.</p>

      <h3><u>SPACE COMPLEXITY</u></h3>
      <p>Best Space Complexity: O(n)</p>
     <p>Worst Space Complexity: O(1)</p>
    <p>Space complexity is defined as how much additional space the algorithm needs in terms of the N elements. And even though according to the docs, the sort method sorts a list in place, it does use some additional space, as stated in the description of the implementation:timsort can require a temp array containing as many as N//2 pointers, which means as many as 2*N extra bytes on 32-bit boxes. It can be expected to require a temp array this large when sorting random data; on data with significant structure, it may get away without using any extra heap memory. </p>

      <h3><u>DEFINATION</u></h3>        
      <p>TimSort is a sorting algorithm based on Insertion Sort and Merge Sort.A stable sorting algorithm works in O(n Log n) time</p>
      <p>Used in Java’s Arrays.sort() as well as Python’s sorted() and sort()</p>
      <p>First sort small pieces using Insertion Sort, then merges the pieces using merge of merge sort.</p>
