    <h1>RADIX SORT</h1>
    <p>Since radix sort is a non-comparative algorithm, it has advantages over comparative sorting algorithms. For the radix sort that uses counting sort as an intermediate stable sort</p>

      <h3><u>TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY</u></h3>
      <p>Best case time complexity:Ω(nk)</p>
     <p>Worst case time complexity:O(nk)</p>
    <p>Average case time complexity:Θ(nk)</p>
    <p>Space complexity:O(n+k)</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3><u>LOGIC</u></h3>
      <p>n is the number of input data and k is the maximum element in the input data</p>
     <p>Let there be d digits in input integers. Radix Sort takes O(d(n+b))* time where b is the base for representing numbers, for example, for decimal system, b is 10. What is the value of d? If k is the maximum possible value, then d would be O(logb(k)). So overall time complexity is O((n+b) * logb(k)). Which looks more than the time complexity of comparison based sorting algorithms for a large k</p>

      <h3><u>Characteristics Of Radix Sort</u></h3>        
      <p>Radix sort is one of the linear sorting algorithms for integers. It functions by sorting the input numbers on each digit, for each of the digits in the numbers. However, the process adopted by this sort method is somewhat counterintuitive, in the sense that the numbers are sorted on the least-significant digit first, followed by the second-least significant digit and so on till the most significant digit.</p>
