      <h3><u>TIME COMPLEXITY</u></h3>
      <p>In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor.</p>

    <p>AVERAGE:: Θ(N log N)</p>

    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3><u>SPACE COMPLEXITY</u></h3>
      <p>Space Complexity of an algorithm is total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. </p>
      <p>Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(n2) space.</p>

      <h3><u>DEFINATION</u></h3>        
      <p>Binary Insertion Sort uses binary search to find the proper location to insert the selected item at each iteration. </p>
      <p>In normal insertion sort, it takes O(n) comparisons (at nth iteration) in the worst case. We can reduce it to O(log n) by using binary search.</p>
