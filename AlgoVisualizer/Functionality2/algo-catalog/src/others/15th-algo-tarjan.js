      <p>Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm is an algorithm in graph theory for finding the strongly connected components (SCCs) of a directed graph.</p>
      <p>It runs in linear time,matching the time bound for alternative methods including Kosaraju's algorithm and the path-based strong component algorithm. </p>
      <p>The algorithm is named for its inventor, Robert Tarjan.</p>
