    <h1>EULARIAN PATH</h1>
    <p>In graph theory, an Eulerian trail (or Eulerian path) is a trail in a finite graph that visits every edge exactly once (allowing for revisiting vertices). </p>

      <h3><u>TIME COMPLEXITY</u></h3>
      <p>In computer science, the time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm. Time complexity is commonly estimated by counting the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm, supposing that each elementary operation takes a fixed amount of time to perform. Thus, the amount of time taken and the number of elementary operations performed by the algorithm are taken to differ by at most a constant factor.</p>
    <p>AVERAGE::While the graph traversal in Fleury's algorithm is linear in the number of edges, i.e. O(|E|), we also need to factor in the complexity of detecting bridges.</p>           
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3><u>SPACE COMPLEXITY</u></h3>
      <p>Space Complexity of an algorithm is total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. Space complexity includes both Auxiliary space and space used by input. </p>
      <p>Space complexity is a parallel concept to time complexity. If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space. If we create a two dimensional array of size n*n, this will require O(n2) space.</p>
    <p>Counting the number of Eulerian circuits on undirected graphs is much more difficult. </p>

      <h3><u>DEFINATION</u></h3>        
      <p>In graph theory, an Eulerian trail (or Eulerian path) is a trail in a finite graph that visits every edge exactly once (allowing for revisiting vertices). </p>
      <p>Similarly, an Eulerian circuit or Eulerian cycle is an Eulerian trail that starts and ends on the same vertex.</p>
      <p>They were first discussed by Leonhard Euler while solving the famous Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg problem in 1736.</p>
