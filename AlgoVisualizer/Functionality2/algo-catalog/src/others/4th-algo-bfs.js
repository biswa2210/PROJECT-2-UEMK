      <h3><u>DEFINATION</u></h3>        
      <p>Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.</p>
      <p>It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.</p>
      <p>It uses the opposite strategy of depth-first search, which instead explores the node branch as far as possible before being forced to backtrack and expand other nodes.</p>
