In computer science, a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.

In computer science, a jump search or block search refers to a search algorithm for ordered lists. It works by first checking all items Lₖₘ, where k\in \mathbb  and m is the block size, until an item is found that is larger than the search key.</p>

  Interpolation search is an algorithm for searching for a key in an array that has been ordered by numerical values assigned to the keys. It was first described by W. W. Peterson in 1957.</p>

    In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. </p>

   The sublist search algorithm works by comparing the first element of the first list with the first element of the second list. If the two values don't match, it goes to the next element of the second list. </p>
