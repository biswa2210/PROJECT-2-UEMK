## About :point_down: 

<div align="justified">
            
*It is the 3rd functionality of my project.* Messaging apps (a.k.a. social messaging or chat applications) are apps and platforms that enable instant messaging. Many such apps have developed into broad platforms enabling status updates, chatbots, payments and conversational commerce (e-commerce via chat). They are normally centralised networks run by the servers of the platform's operators, unlike peer-to-peer protocols like XMPP. The DISCUSSION part will take the user to a login page where he has to give username and password (firebase-provided password in home page). Then he will be added in a discussion group for doubt clearing where I will answer his questions regarding this website. Here user can send messages and images in chat.
</div>


## Things needed for signup/login :point_down:

 - [x] username
 - [x] password(provided to user)

## Purpose :point_down:

<div align="justified">
            
The purpose of the discussion is to interpret and describe the significance of your findings in light of what was already known about the research problem being investigated and to explain any new understanding or insights that emerged as a result of your study of the problem. Group discussion on study topics plays vital role in understanding the topic. Discussing a topic with friends or classmates helps in learning the topic with perfection. Group discussion on a topic involves sharing of learning by the participants which equally benefits all the participants. I have made this to make study easier.
</div>

## Use :point_down:

Click on discussions. Here user has to enter his username and password (firebase-provided password in home page). Then he will be added in a discussion group for doubt clearing where the developers will answer his questions regarding this website.

## Importance :point_down:

Discussion is important for any queries of user. When developers guide the user properly it will very helpful for the user to explore the web site and study algorithms.

## Making :point_down:

It has been created using advance JavaScript, advance CSS3, SCSS, ReactJS, advance HTML5, Firebase, Chat Engine XDK, nodejs and Formik. It is fully responsive. For chatting I have used [chat engine](https://chatengine.io/). For password I have used [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
